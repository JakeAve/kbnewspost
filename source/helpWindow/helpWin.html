        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
            The KBase News Post application allows users to send updates directly to
            the Knowledge Base. Use the following steps will help you successfully create a post to your News and
            Updates page.
        </div>
        <ol class="how-to-list">
            <li>Create a Headline</li>
            <div>
                Identify the main message you want to communicate to your readers. Your
                headline should only be a few words long. The time and date will
                automatically generate as you type and before you post.
            </div>
            <li>Write Content</li>
            <div>
                Express your message in a few sentances. The tool bar at the bottom of
                the content box allows you to style text, create lists and insert other
                data. You can also right click your mouse to access the same
                tools. All of the tools, with the exception of the image button, work
                best when you highlight the piece of text you would like to edit and
                then choose a style. Because of this, it is easiest to write out all of your
                content before using tools.
            </div>
            <div>
                The buttons to the left allow you to bold, underline or change the color
                of text to red. To improve readability, these styles should be used
                sparingly (1 time per post) or not at all.
            </div>
            <div>
                The tool bar also has two list buttons. One creates an unordered list
                and the other creates a numbered list.
            </div>
            <div>
                The last two buttons allow you to create a link or add an image. Both of
                these require a full URL such as <em>"https://www.youngliving.com/en_US"</em> to function properly.
                Only use images when it is absolutely necessary.
            </div>
            <li>Choose icon(s)</li>

            <li>Send post to the Kbase</li>
            <div>The post should be sent within seconds. You will need to acknowledge your success or error message by
                clicking "OK."</div>
            <li>Preview update</li>
            <div>You will be able to preview the updated page directly in the application. The preview shows all of the
                content on your news page, including your new post. Select "Finish" to keep the post or use the "Undo" button
                to remove your most recent post. You can also select "View in Kbase" to see your live News and Updates page in a web browser.</div>
            <li>Finish</li>
